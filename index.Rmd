## About Me

Hi! I'm a bird bander working under an ornithologist at SLCC on a research project that focuses on five songbird species: the American Robin, Black-Capped Chickadee, Song Sparrow, Sayâ€™s Phoebe, and House Finch. Our goal is to monitor their survival and productivity in differing levels of urbanization over time.

In the field, we set up mist nets and play species-specific calls to safely capture birds. Each individual gets a unique metal band and a custom color band combination so we can identify them from a distance (no need to recapture). This helps us track movements, breeding success, and life histories in a minimally invasive way.

My favorite bird (hands down) is the Black-Capped Chickadee. They pack a whole lot of personality and fight in the smallest body, and their intelligence is off the charts. Below are two images of banded Black-Capped Chickadees from our study.
